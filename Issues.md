 I am Cameron Brown and I am a Senior Computer Science Major with a Focus in Information Assurance. I intend to find a job in some form of software development or cybersecurity. 

 My Role in the group will be handling the front end part of the project. I will tackle issues like the layout, the UI and overall user experience when using the software.
